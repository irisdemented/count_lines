# count_lines

A command line python program that counts number of lines in a text or csv file.

I created this program for 2 reaons:
 - I often need a full count of lines in one or more txt or csv files  
 - I wanted to practice packaging a program and putting it on github
 
# what does it do? 

It takes a file or directory and counts the lines of any text or csv file.

# input

Input is either a file or a directory.  

If file is not a txt or csv it will report that to you in the output.  

# usage

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where the program is installed. 

python3 count_lines.py '/path/to/file/or/directory'

and the result will output in the terminal.
